Martin is a lightweight open source mp3 player for OSX.

You point it to your music folders, and Martin displays them in the tree pane on the left.
Your files and folders are scanned and kept in internal library, which makes searching and browsing fast. Folders are watched for changes automatically.

Playlists are displayed in a tabbed interface.

There is last.fm support and some global shortcuts for controlling playback.

I've been working on Martin because I couldn't find anything out there to my liking.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.
I apologize in advance for any annoying bugs that you may encounter.
