=========

Martin is a lightweight open source mp3 player for OSX.

It uses a library, music collection is scanned and tracks info is stored to allow faster searching and browsing.

Your folders are watched for changes automatically.

There's a tree of your folder hierarchy on the left and you can drag and drop stuff around to manage playlists.

It has global shortcuts and last.fm support.

I've been working on this for my own needs because I couldn't find anything similar.

Feel free to contact me if you have questions or suggestions.

I apologize in advance for any annoying bugs that you may encounter.
