=========

Martin is a lightweight open source mp3 player for OSX.
It uses a library, your music collection is scanned and stored to allow faster searching and browsing.
There's a foobar-like tree of your folder hierarchy on the left and you can drag and drop stuff around to manage playlists.
Global shortcuts and last.fm support are included, but no other annoying features are present.

I've been working on this for my own needs becuase I couldn't find something similar.
If you have a large nicely organized collection try using it and see how it goes.
Feel free to contact me if you have questions curses or suggestions.
